Dominatrix Review | The Best Massage I Have Ever Had in Shanghai

People are often surprised when they hear a dominatrix speak seriously about massage. They imagine domination as something abrupt or theatrical. In reality, the opening moments of a session matter more than anything that follows.

I am BDSM coach and professional dominatrix Alessandra, based in Shanghai. At the beginning of almost every session, I give a clear instruction: you will start by massaging my body.

This is not a courtesy. It is a test.

Why Massage Comes First

Ordering a submissive to massage me immediately establishes hierarchy. They are there to serve, to observe, to adapt. Through their hands, I learn how well they listen, how quickly they respond to correction, and how comfortable they are surrendering control.

Many submissives have no formal massage experience. In those cases, I instruct them—calmly, precisely, sometimes repeatedly. How they adjust tells me everything about their mindset. Do they become nervous? Do they overthink? Or do they settle into obedience and focus?

Others arrive with experience. Those sessions are different. I can close my eyes and simply receive, enjoying the competence, the rhythm, and the awareness in their touch.

Both types are valuable. Very few are exceptional.

One Who Stood Out Among Hundreds

Over the years, more than 700 submissives have massaged me at the beginning of a session. Most are forgettable. A small number are good. One Belgian man stood out immediately.

He did not rush. He did not hesitate. His hands communicated confidence without ego, attentiveness without tension. He adjusted instinctively, responding to my breathing, my posture, my smallest reactions—without needing constant instruction.

What made him exceptional was not technique alone, but presence. He understood that the massage was not about him proving anything. It was about serving well.

That level of awareness is rare.

A Dominatrix’s Perspective

From my position, massage is not about relaxation in the conventional sense. It is about control, attunement, and discipline. It reveals character faster than words ever could.

When I say it was the best massage I have had in Shanghai, I am not speaking as a client browsing spas. I am speaking as a dominatrix who has received hundreds of massages from men eager to please—and who knows exactly how to distinguish effort from mastery.

Most never realize they are being evaluated.

The ones who do, never forget the experience.
